## Welcome to the bot watch project.

In March of 2017, the University of Southern California released a study estimating that some nine to fifteen percent of all twitter accounts (or up to 48,000,000 accounts) were bots. A study by Indiana University researchers released in November 2018 highlights the disproportionate role that bots played in spreading ‘low credibility’ information in connection with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 

Bot watch aims to identify bots and bot activity through machine learning techniques and then visualize bot activity in a way that is useful in understanding, analyzing snd dealing with the impact these automated accounts have on the flow of information and ideas. 

Specifically, bot watch focuses on twitter bots which are active in political and culturally divisive topics, with the apparent aim of playing upon and amplifying fear, anger and cognitive distortions.
